###### I'm Amin, a 18-year-old developer from Iran who goes by "Aiden Fier" in media.

###### I started my journey as a backend and frontend developer, diving into coding and building projects that solve real-world problems. My passion lies in creating clean, efficient code and designing applications that are both functional and visually appealing.

###### While I may not have worked on countless projects, the ones Iâ€™ve completed have helped me grow and sharpen my skills in web development. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, building APIs, and creating intuitive user interfaces that make an impact.

###### Need help with a project or custom application? Feel free to reach out to me!
